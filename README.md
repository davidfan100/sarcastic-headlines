# Sarcastic Headlines
### This will be one of my first mini projects relating to data science. My first analysis will be on headlines from popular news websites on whether they are sarcastic or not. My analysis will be what words pertain to the most sarcastic headlines. This analysis will be supplmented by a data visualization (not sure what kind yet)

(If i get that part done, may look into creating a program to take in a headline and calculate how sarcastic a headline is!!!)
